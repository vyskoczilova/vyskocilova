Karolína Vyskočilová - WordPress developer

I'm a WordPress and WooCommerce developer specializing in custom websites and plugins. I like to polish the clients’ ideas to perfection, showing them that a website can do more than they ever imagined, and I always make sure that my clients can handle the administration of their new website with their eyes closed.

I'm a freelancer with over 120 projects under my belt, and you can find some of my plugins in the WordPress repository. I also offer consulting services to clients, and I teach seminars on WordPress. I'm programming for more than 15 years now, specializing in WordPress for the last 7 of them.
